## Abstract

Mismanagement of water resources is one of the
most pressing issues in developing countries like Pakistan. With
the burgeoning population growth and migration to urban spaces
for economic opportunities, freshwater resources are becoming
highly stressed and polluted. In this paper, we present the
design of a cost effective low power flowmeter with embedded
intelligence and remote telemetry for urban residential water
metering applications. The study provides fundamental architecture of water metering IoT node and necessary details of
implementation. Results of the study are presented in terms of
power consumption, accuracy and reliability of device in lab and
in field setting. The proposed system could assist developing cities
in estimating realistic water demand and creating sustainable
socio-political urban water policies at the decision-making level.
